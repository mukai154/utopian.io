Webblen.io was Forked from Utopian.io, make sure to checkout the platform in order to earn rewards for participating in the project. Through integrating our existing applications (currently hidden but to be open-sourced soon), we leverage steem's block chain to incentivise community involvement.

[Utopian.io](https://utopian.io) wants to reward Open Source contributors for their hard work. 
Forked from https://github.com/busyorg/busy, Utopian uses the [STEEM Blockchain](https://steem.io) to reward contributors in cryptocurrency.

See the website in action [here:](https://utopian.io)

## Contributing to this Project
1. Join webblenIO on Discord: https://discord.gg/5cxGQmt or Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEwPh5GOiHAZQ-QeJg
2. Clone this repository locally on your computer. If you don't have `git` installed, simply pressing the "Download ZIP" button and unzipping the file should work.
3. **Locally**, go to the `webpack/webpack-dev-server.js` file. Change the line that begins with `UTOPIAN_API` to this:
```javascript
UTOPIAN_API: JSON.stringify(process.env.UTOPIAN_API || 'https://api.utopian.io/api/'),
```
Remember not to push this change to the repository in your commits/pull requests.

4. Use Terminal or your Command Prompt and change the directory to the `utopian.io` directory (`cd`). 
5. Once you're inside the `utopian.io` directory in Terminal, run these commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev-server
```
These commands may take a while to process, because it needs to download everything necessary to start Utopian. Once it's done, wait for text like this:

This fork is now running on your machine! 
* To access the local website, use any browser and go to `localhost:3000/` (or whatever Terminal says next to "Project is running at".)
* To make a code change, use any editor to change any file in the code locally. If you change a `.js` file, the `webpack` will _automatically_ update itself and reload any browser pages that are viewing your local snapshot.
* When submitting a pull request, make sure to uncheck/delete the original `webpack-dev-server.js` code change, as that's only used for running the project locally.

#### API Server
Utopian's sister project [utopian-io/api.utopian.io](https://github.com/utopian-io/api.utopian.io) provides the back-end APIs for Utopian. If you want to run this locally, you **do not** need to run that project, though you may want to check it out anyways!
